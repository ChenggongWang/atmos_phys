 * added time manager module

     - argument changes to physics_driver include:
         timesince (integer) --> time (time_type)
         timesince_rad removed (replaced by a namelist value in
                                radiation_driver)

     - argument changes in physics_driver_init include (also see below):
         timesince (integer) --> time      (time_type)
         date(4) (integer)   --> time_init (time_type)
         (the call to physics_diag_init also reflects this change)

     - date module initialization no longer done in physics_driver_init
       this must be done through the time manager module by the user

     - argument to physics_driver_end has changed
         timesince (integer) --> time (time_type)

 * cleaned up check_dim subroutine

 * physics_driver_init interface now passes the grid box edges,
   calls to surface_model_init and radiation_driver_init also
   reflect this change
